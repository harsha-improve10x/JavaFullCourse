 /*    Java:- Java is an Object-oriented programming language that is used to develop
              Mobile Applications, Web Applications, Desktop Applications, Games etc...

       Features of Java:-
       1. It is easy to learn and simple to use.
       2. It is secure, fast and powerful.
       3. It is independent platform like Windows, Mac, Linux etc...

       How Java Works?
       First create a main method in the file and write a code
       after that when you run the code, the process of jvm happens which means
       it compiles the source code to the byte code, and then it interprets the
       bytecode to the operating system.

       Java Architecture:-
       Java architecture consists of JVM, JRE and JDK.

       JDK(Java Development Kit):- Java development kit is used by the developers
       so that they can read, write, modify, and run the program.

       JRE(Java Runtime Environment):- Java Runtime Environment is used to
       read and run the program. in this you cannot edit the program.

       JVM(Java Virtual Machine):- It is a process that happens during the runtime.
       When you run the program source code compiles to bytecode and then jvm interprets
       the bytecode to it's operating system.
